# Walsh and Co Original Interior Design

![Am I Responsive image of how the landing page looks across different browser sizes](assets/images/am-i-responsive.png)

I created this website for the 1st Milestone Project on User Centric Frontend, at Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development course. 

I wanted to create a website to showcase a fictional luxury interior design company, based in Ireland and England.  
The website features an initial landing page, and four additional pages of content.
# UX

  * ## Project Research

    I have worked in and managed a trade paint shop since 2016. Having served thousands of customers, I have a good understanding of the expectations people have when it comes to the finish of their homes. 

    * ### Research Analysis

      As people have had to spend a lot more time at home since the start of the pandemic, there has been a huge increase in home improvements.
      
      Everyone wants an 'Instaworthy' home with a high-end finish. 

  * ## Persona and Their Goals

    The ideal customer for this company is wealthy. 
    
    They are looking for luxury with no expense spared. They believe in spending on quality materials. 
    
    They want a bespoke experience, tailored to their every desire. 
    
    They want a service that is going to take them form conception to completion, by a team that they can trust.

  * ## User Stories
    1. As a user visiting the site for the first time, I want to navigate the site intuitively.
    2. As a user, I want to know what services are provided, and what is involved in the process.
    3. As a user, I want to be able to find out the cost of the services provided.
    4. As a user, I want to be able to see past projects, in order to know if this is the right company for me.
    5. As a user, I want to be able to contact the company.
    6. As a user, I want to book an appointment.
    7. As a user, I want to enquire about something that I didn't see covered on the website.
    8. As a user, I want to know where you are located.
    9. As a user, I want to be able to access your social media accounts.
    10. As a user, I want to know who I will be dealing with.

  * ## Design
    * ## Colour Scheme
      I wanted a neutral colour scheme that wasn't going to detract from the overall flow of the website. I settled on my Hero Image very early on. I used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to generate a [colour](assets/docs/colour-palette.jpg) pallette for the website from my Hero Image. This meant that the colours complimented each other nicely. 
    * ## Favicon 
      I used the website [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to create a favicon for my website. I wanted to keep the neutral theme of the website I kept the background colour the same as the header and footer sections, I used the same font for the headings and logo and left it as a simple 'W', so as not to be too busy.
    * ## Typography
      I wanted an elegant looking font to bolster the feeling of luxury throughout the site. I liked the contrast between the font for the headings which is Fairplay Display, and the font for the rest of the website.
    * ## Imagery
      All imagery was sourced from the website, [Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com/)

      The images that I chose were subtly oppulent, which fit the site well. The hero image is neutral, and decorated to a high standard which sets a good first impression for the site. I wanted all the images to be aesthetically pleasing to convey quality that I was aiming for.
    * ## Layout
      I decided on a multi paged website because I felt like each topic deserved it's own dedicated page. I wanted the hero image to take up the entire space above the fold on the landing page, in order to make a good first impression. I opted for a larger than 'standard' footer as I feel like a more substantial footer leads to a more elegant feeling. The opaque overlay finishes it off nicely.
