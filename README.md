# UX

  * ## Project Research

    I have worked in and managed a trade paint shop since 2016. Having served thousands of customers, I have a good understanding of the expectations people have when it comes to the finish of their homes. 

    * ### Research Analysis

      As people have had to spend a lot more time at home since the start of the pandemic, there has been a huge increase in home improvements.
      
      Everyone wants an 'Instaworthy' home with a high-end finish. 

  * ## Persona and Their Goals

    The ideal customer for this company is wealthy. 
    
    They are looking for luxury with no expense spared. They believe in spending on quality materials. 
    
    They want a bespoke experience, tailored to their every desire. 
    
    They want a service that is going to take them form conception to completion, by a team that they can trust.

  * ## User Stories
